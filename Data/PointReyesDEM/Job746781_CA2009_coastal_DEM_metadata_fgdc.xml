                Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data is remotely sensed high-resolution elevation data collected by an airborne collection
platform. This LiDAR dataset is a survey of Coastal California. The project area consists of approximately 2616 square miles.
The project design of the LiDAR data acquisition was developed to support a nominal post spacing of 1 meter. Fugro EarthData,
Inc. acquired 1546 flight lines in 108 lifts between October 2009 and August 2011. LiDAR data collection was performed with two
Piper Navajo twin engine aircrafts, utilizing a Leica ALS60 MPiA sensor; collecting multiple return x, y, and z as well as
intensity data. The bare-earth lidar data was used to create hydro-flattened DEMs (Digital Elevation Models) available for
download from the NOAA OCM Digital Coast.
