# Shoreline Digitization Tool Introduction

The shoreline digitization script tool for ArcGIS Pro automates the creation of a shoreline (water edge) feature from multi-band aerial imagery.  Additional tool outputs include water body polygons that allow for easy water surface area calculations as well as a contour drawn on a DEM at a user-input ground reference water level value.  This contour allows the tool user to visually assess the difference between the script tool's derived shoreline feature and the shoreline that would be expected based on the water level (tide) at the time of multi-band imagery capture.

Here is a Youtube introductory and instructional video:
